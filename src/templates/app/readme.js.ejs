> <%= props.name %>

#### Install

First you must rename the`.env.example` file found in the project root` .env`, for example:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

For the docker environment you should proceed as follows:

``` bash
# install project dependencies
make install

# creates javascript files
make build

# run service at address http://<%= props.name %>.docker.localhost
make run
```

__IMPORTANT__: You can, locally, perform the steps with the following commands:

``` bash
# install project dependencies
npm install

# creates javascript files
npm run build

# run service at address http://localhost:3000
npm run serve
```

#### Test

For the test you can access the container`node_<%= props.name %>` and run the local environment commands, for example:

``` bash
make in

# runs all project tests
npm test

# to run a specific test for a .test.ts file
npm run test:file <file_path>
```

with Dockerfile use the next commands:

``` bash
# runs all project tests
make test

# to run a specific test for a .test.ts file
make test-file path='<file_path>'
```
